# ArduinoMonsterTrap
DIY Monster Trap for Kids

As my son won't sleep alone thinking that there is monster in his bedroom, I create a Monster Trap. 

This based on an arduino nano, SRF05 sensor and a Neopixel ring as indicator. 

Code is really simple. 
- If the case is opened : Red light and a beep
- If the case is closed and there is no monster : Blue light
- If the case is closed and these is a monster : Rainbow light
